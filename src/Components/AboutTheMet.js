      <h2>About The Met</h2>
      <p>
        The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City, colloquially "the Met",
        is the largest art museum in the United States. Its permanent collection
        contains over two million works, divided among 17 curatorial
        departments. The main building at 1000 Fifth Avenue, along the Museum
        Mile on the eastern edge of Central Park in Manhattan's Upper East Side,
        is by area one of the world's largest art museums. A much smaller second
        location, The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan, contains
        an extensive collection of art, architecture, and artifacts from
        medieval Europe. <br />
        The museum's permanent collection consists of works of art from
        classical antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings, and sculptures from
        nearly all the European masters, and an extensive collection of American
        and modern art. The Met maintains extensive holdings of African, Asian,
        Oceanian, Byzantine, and Islamic art. The museum is home to encyclopedic
        collections of musical instruments, costumes, and accessories, as well
        as antique weapons and armor from around the world. Several notable
        interiors, ranging from 1st-century Rome through modern American design,
        are installed in its galleries. <br />
        The Metropolitan Museum of Art was founded in 1870 to bring art and art
        education to the American people. The Fifth Avenue building opened on
        February 20, 1872, at 681 Fifth Avenue.
